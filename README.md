- [x] Create folders based on key photo text and move photos.
- [x] Celebrate by watching Game of Thrones if everything works on simple data.
- [ ] Text recognition using OpenCV.
- [ ] Refine key photo identification based on text recognition and heuristics
- [ ] Image cropping and passing to Tesseract.
- [ ] Tesseract error handling and key photo likelihood.
- [ ] Evaluate algorithm on full complex image dataset.
- [ ] Speed up text recognition using TensorFlow
- [ ] Build a GUI interface

## OCR-Image-Sort Overview
The proposed system will process a sequential set of equipment images and identify key photos. 
A key photo is a photo that contains the tag or nameplate of an equipment and is the first photo in a photo set of that equipment. 
In the above example, key photos are p_1^1,p_1^2,and p_1^3. 
The system will be built to run on a personal desktop or laptop computer, but not on a mobile platform such as a phone or camera. 
The system will label all the photos associated with the key photo with the appropriate tag and sequence up to the next key photo (see figure 1 below).

The system will be based on three main technologies: Python3, OpenCV [1], and Tesseract [2]. 
Python3 will be the general wrapper for all system components and will sort and label the photos. 
OpenCV will be used to identify areas in each photo that contain text. 
Tesseract will be used to transcribe the text in each area identified by OpenCV [3]. 
Python3 will evaluate the likelihood that the photo is a key photo.
